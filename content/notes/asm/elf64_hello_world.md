title: ELF64 hello world
---

Work in progress...

I like to understand how things work under the hood. Assembly programming is very close to the metal but, even then, the assembler hides some complexity to make our lives easier. Also the linker does lots of work I don't completely understand.

So I though I would make an executable by hand, where every bit in it is understood. The resulting ELF64 executable is very small (160 bytes) compared with the executables generated by C compilers and even assemblers.

I found the [wikepedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format) on the ELF format to be quite handy, although I also had to look up other resorces (all of them at the end).

The executable has only one program segment that contains both code and data. There are no sections. Segments and sections are different things[^so_section_vs_segment] [^section_vs_segment_ciro].

I also read [this article](https://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/software/tiny/teensy.html) about making the smallest possible ELF32 executable that returns 42. Lots of tricks are used in order to make the executable as small a possible, even some that abuse the ELF format spec, like overlapping different sections. We are not going to go as far, just try to make the simplest hello world. Also, I'm going to make an ELF64 instead. There is also [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53382589/smallest-executable-program-x86-64) in StackOverflow where they also try to make the smallest possible ELF64.

We could make our executable by typing it in a hex editor. But there are other more convenient ways.

In the resources just mentioned, they use NASM with a special flag `-f bin`. With this flag, only what is specified in the `.asm` source file will appear in the output binary file (when we compile normaly, NASM creates for you the ELF headers and so on). This is what one of this `.asm` files would look like (copied from the forementioned StackOverflow post):

```nasm

ehdr:                                     ; Elf64_Ehdr

            dq  phdr - $$                 ;   e_phoff
            dq  0                         ;   e_shoff
            dd  0                         ;   e_flags
            dw  ehdrsize                  ;   e_ehsize
            dw  phdrsize                  ;   e_phentsize

            dw  0                         ;   e_shstrndx

ehdrsize    equ $ - ehdr

phdr:                                     ; Elf64_Phdr
            dd  1                         ;   p_type
            dd  7                         ;   p_flags
            dq  0                         ;   p_offset
            dq  $$                        ;   p_vaddr
            dq  $$                        ;   p_paddr
            dq  filesize                  ;   p_filesz
            dq  filesize                  ;   p_memsz
            dq  0x1000                    ;   p_align

phdrsize    equ     $ - phdr

_start:
   mov di,42        ; only the low byte of the exit code is kept,
                    ; so we can use di instead of the full edi/rdi
   xor eax,eax
   mov al,60        ; shorter than mov eax,60
   syscall          ; perform the syscall

filesize      equ     $ - $$
```

And we can compile it with:

```
nasm -f bin min64.asm -o min64
```

But instead of using NASM for generating the executable, I opted to use a small C program that writes a binary file. Because in the future I want to make a compiler in C that doesn't require an assembler.

```c

typedef struct Elf64_PhtEntry {
    u32 segmentType; // 1: loadable segment, 2: dynamic linking info
    u32 flags; // segment-dependent flags (position for 64-bit structure)

```

Inside the [Program header](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format#Program_header), I struggled a lot with the `p_offset` field ([and I'm not the only one](https://cirosantilli.com/elf-hello-world#p-191)). If you didn't notice, the value of `p_offset` is 0. But the [spec](https://refspecs.linuxbase.org/elf/gabi4+/ch5.pheader.html) says:
> This member gives the offset from the beginning of the file at which the first byte of the segment resides

And our executable layout looks like this:

|  |  |
| :------ |:--- |
| Elf64Header | 64 bytes |
| Program Header Entry | 56 bytes |
| Program Segment | ... |

So shouldn't `p_offset` be 64+56=120?

That would make sense but that's not how it works. The Linux executable loader, only loads to memory the segments as they are specified. That means, data that doesn't belong to a segment, is not loaded. Therefore, the ELF header and the Program Header Table, as they also need to be loaded to memory, need to be within the range of one segment. And, since we only have one segment, that segment must cover the whole file! I haven't been able to find any official resource to verify this claim, but here are some resources that mention it:
